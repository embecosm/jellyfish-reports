# Jellyfish reports

This repository contains the reports for project Jellyfish

## Usage

Reports will be built in a `build` directory. To build all reports use `all` rule from the makefile.

```bash
make all
```

Otherwise you may build one report using it's file name.

```bash
make 2025-09-09-report.md
```

You may generate parts of the next report using the `create.sh` script.

```bash
./create.sh
```
