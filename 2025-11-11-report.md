# Project Jellyfish weekly report

2025-11-11

## Overview

- Binutils testing

## Review of the past week

- Binutils testing
  - Work has been rebased on top of the main branch
  - Release [pull request opened](https://github.com/tenstorrent/sfpi-binutils/pull/7)
  - Following a discussion with Nathan the operand letter has been changed from `m` to `l`
  - The instruction operand format has been changed from `J3l1` to `J3u2l1`, which is slightly more complex but more in line with Nathan's recent changes.
  - *COMPLETE*
- Extra instructions
  - Waiting for written agreement
  - Specification issues
    - Conflicting result register values
      - `RD_TILES_TO_PROCESS_THRES_TR_ACK`
      - `RD_TILES_TO_PROCESS_THRES_WR_SENT`
      - `RD_TILES_TO_PROCESS_THRES_IDMA_TR_ACK`
    - Invalid description

      - `CMDBUF_READ_TILES_TO_PROCESS_IDMA_TR_ACK_TR_ID`
      - `SCMDBUF_READ_TILES_TO_PROCESS_TR_ACK_TR_ID`

## Plan for the next week

- WP5: Implement extra instructions (Pierre-Emmanuel)
- WP6: Add GCC builtins (Arthur)

## Work package progress

- [x] *WP1* - Extend the tool chain drivers
- [x] *WP2* - Add assembler/disassembler support for the ISA extension
- [x] *WP3* - Test the assembler and disassembler
- [x] *WP4* - Add builtin function support for the ISA extension
- [ ] *WP5* - Add and test 24 extra instructions to binutils (pending new PO)
- [ ] *WP6* - Add and test GCC builtins for the 24 extra instructions (pending new PO)

- Instructions added to binutils: 70/70, 0/24
- Binutils instructions tested: 70/70, 0/24
- Builtins completed: 70/70, 0/24
- Builtins tested: 70/70, 0/24

|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| MS0* | Project SoW signed-off, Tenstorrent PO received, and down-payment invoiced by Ashling.                         | Sep 2, 2025  |
| MS1* | Initial release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support.\newline At this stage all the functionalities will be present, but testing will not have been completed. | Oct 28, 2025    |
| MS2 | Final release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support.\newline All testing will be complete, and there will be no new regressions in either GCC or GNU binutils.  | Nov 25, 2025    |
| MS3 | Final release of additional 24 instructions.\newline All testing will be complete, and there will be no new regressions in either GCC or GNU binutils.                       | PO+2w           |
