# Project Jellyfish weekly report

2025-09-30

## Overview

- Binutils CMDBUF encodings
- GCC Builtins support

## Review of the past week

- WP2: Add binutils support for the ISA extension
  - Working the CMDBUF encodings to take into account reg and cmdbuf
    - ~~Planning to do them as `ttrocc.cmdbuf_0_wr_reg_3`~~
      - ~~110 different encodings for this instruction~~
    - The register values must be known at compile time and will be encoded as an immediate value instead of separate instructions.
  - *IN PROGRESS*
- WP3: Test the assembler and disassembler
  - *IN PROGRESS*
- WP4: Builtin function API now specified
  - builtin stubs are being implemented
  - *IN PROGRESS*

## Plan for the next week

- WP2: Continue work on binutils (Pietra)
  - Send a patch to Nathan (Pietra)
- WP3: Test assembler support (Pierre-Emmanuel)
- WP4: Add builtin function support (Arthur)

| MS0       | Project SoW signed-off, Tenstorrent PO received, and down-payment invoiced by Ashling.                                                                              | T0=Sep-2, 2025             |
| MS1       | Initial release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. At this stage all the functionalities will be present, but testing will not have been completed | T0+5w = Est. Oct-7, 2025   |
| MS2       | Final release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. All testing will be complete, and there will be no new regressions in either GCC or GNU binutils  | T0+10w = Est. Nov-11, 2025 |
