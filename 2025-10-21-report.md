## Overview

- Binutils Simple command buffer support
- Binutils testing
- GCC builtins support

## Review of the past week

- Assembler status
  - All 17 address generator instructions have been implemented
  - CMDBUF operand format as specified on 2025-09-30
  - *COMPLETE*
- Binutils testing
  - Certain instruction values overlap
    - `tt.rocc.addrgen_push_src_pop_x 1,a1` vs `tt.rocc.addrgen_wr_reg	zero,1,28,a1,zero`
    - `0x3800202B` vs `0xXX00202B` : Funct 7 is `(X*32) + 28` vs `(X*32) + (Y/8)`
  - *IN PROGRESS*
- Builtins
  - All GCC builtins are now complete
  - The builtins have been rebased on top of Nathan's branch
  - We still need to rebase the extension work
  - *IN PROGRESS*

## Plan for the next week

- WP3: Add binutils tests (Pierre-Emmanuel)
- WP3: Ask Djordje about instruction overlap (Pierre-Emmanuel)
- WP4: Rebase extension support on top of Nathan's work (Arthur)
- MS1: Provide initial binutils release through a pull request (Pierre-Emmanuel)

## Work package progress

| MS0 | Project SoW signed-off, Tenstorrent PO received, and down-payment invoiced by Ashling.                                                                              | T0=Sep-2, 2025  |
| MS1 | Initial release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. At this stage all the functionalities will be present, but testing will not have been completed | Oct 28, 2025    |
| MS2 | Final release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. All testing will be complete, and there will be no new regressions in either GCC or GNU binutils  | Nov 25, 2025    |
