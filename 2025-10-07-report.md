2025-10-07

## Overview

- Binutils CMDBUF support
- GCC builtins support

## Review of the past week

- WP2: Add binutils support for the ISA extension
  - New specification provided by Tenstorrent to Embecosm on 2025-09-30
  - Twenty new cmdbuf instruction implemented
  - Six misc instructions implemented
  - *IN PROGRESS*
- WP4: Builtin function support for the ISA extension
  - Specification available [here](https://github.com/embecosm/jellyfish-reports/blob/master/builtin-spec.h)
  - Structure for builtins ready
    - `__builtin_rvtt_rocc_noc_fence` & `__builtin_rvtt_rocc_dbg_postcode` implemented and tested
    - `__builtin_rvtt_rocc_cmdbuf_wr_reg` & `__builtin_rvtt_rocc_cmdbuf_rd_reg` implemented
    - Note: Upstreaming will require the builtins to follow RISC-V standard naming for GCC and LLVM, which is `__builtin_riscv_tt_<name>`
  - *IN PROGRESS*
- RISCV configuration questions

## Plan for the next week

- WP2: Continue work on binutils (Pietra & Pierre-Emmanuel)
- WP4: Add builtin function support (Arthur)

## Work package progress

- [x] *WP1* - Extend the tool chain drivers
- [ ] *WP2* - Add assembler/disassembler support for the ISA extension
- [ ] *WP3* - Test the assembler and disassembler
- [ ] *WP4* - Add builtin function support for the ISA extension

- Instructions added to binutils: 30/70

| MS0 | Project SoW signed-off, Tenstorrent PO received, and down-payment invoiced by Ashling.                                                                              | T0=Sep-2, 2025                        |
| MS1 | Initial release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. At this stage all the functionalities will be present, but testing will not have been completed | T0+5w "subject to delay" on MS1/2     |
| MS2 | Final release of GCC and GNU binutils with ISA extension support. All testing will be complete, and there will be no new regressions in either GCC or GNU binutils  | T0+10w $\approx$\newline Nov-25, 2025 |

- MS1 deadline under review
